This file describes the annotations that are used in hamsterdb's sources.

When looking through the sources you might have noticed something akin to
annotations from java, i.e.

        @exception_safe yes
        @thread_safe unknown

These annotations currently have only decorative purpose and help documenting
the class. They also serve as a "TODO" list; i.e. if @thread_safe is unknown 
then more analysis has to be performed.

    @exception_safe
    see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_safety

    - unknown: Can be anything; needs more analysis
    - nothrow: Exceptions will be handled internaly; an exception is never
        thrown
    - strong: Operations can fail, but failure will not have side effects.
        If an Exception is thrown then the original data is retained
    - basic: Partial execution of failed operations can cause side effects,
        but all invariants are preserved and no resources are leaked.
        Stored data will remain valid, but might have new values.
    - no: No guarantees are made

    @thread_safe
    see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety
    - unknown: Can be anything; needs more analysis
    - yes: Code is free of race conditions when accessed simultaneously
    - conditionally: Access from shared data is protected from race
        conditions
    - no: Code should not be accessed simultaneously from different threads
